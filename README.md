Kickstarter Analysis - Module 1
# Kickstarting with Excel

## **Overview of Project**

Goal of the project was to be able to assist Louise in finding out and comparing other plays that were successful, failed or canceled in meeting their funding.   Reviewing data from 1047 plays globally and best months that theatres host plays would be beneficial for Louise to understand where she needs to focus efforts overall.


### **Purpose**
Help determine if goals are being met and evaluate strongest months for play.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
Outcomes Based on Launch Date vs. Outcomes Based on Goals

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
May, June & July are the strongest months for plays.   December is the lowest sales of the year. The average cancellation is 41 plays per month.


### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**
66% of plays globally are successful, 34% of plays failed and 0 were canceled.  58% of the launches were successful.

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

## **Results**

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. December is weakest month and would break even for all launches.
2. May is the strongest month with only 47% failed launch.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Highest percentage of successful plays pledged less than $1000 goals and zero cancellations.  The total number of projects are 1047, 66% of plays are successful and 34% of plays had failed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Some limitations on the dataset would be there is no data on price of tickets to determine profit margins for any successful categories.
2. The data missing on cost of marketing and advertising to determine dollars spent on successful, canceled, or failed plays.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Most successful sub-categories
Failed sub-categories
